<h1>instagramClone 📷</h1>

<p>Hi Everyone, I've cloned instagram in order to practice and test my skills and I'd like to share the result</p>
<p> of this experience with you guys, Hope it can be useful for some of you :)</p>

### Libraries, Frameworks and Code Patterns I used in this project</b></p>

* binding
* livedata ⏺️
* MVVM 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
* FireStore 🔥
* Storage 📅
* Glide 📸
* ImageCropper ✂️
* CircleImageView ⚫



<p> My database logic was create based in how firestorage can connect uniques id's and make them interact with each other,</p>
<p> I was careful with my app's performance therefore my plans was make it runs as smooth as possible, accomplishing that wasn't easy</p>
<p> once there are lots of information to retrieve and upload all the time</p>

#### My own Artistic Touch 

<p>I decided to personalize the desing and it looked outstading at the very end, I'm so proud of the final result i got</p>

- Soon I'ma uploading a gift of how it's looking so far
